# Getting Started with Storybook in React

# Overview

[\*\*Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)\*\* is a JavaScript tool to create organised UI systems making both the building process and documentation more efficient and easier to use.

**Usage**: visual way to document UI components.

Once you build out a component, Storybook lets you create a "story" file where you can then import your component and create various use case examples in an iFramed sandbox using that component.

# How to build using React Stack?

---

- First create react app

```bash
npx create-react-app my-storybook
cd my-storybook
```

- Initializing and Starting up Storybook

```bash
npx sb init
npm run storybook
```

And once everything finishes loading, Storybook will open a new tab in your browser and you should now see a welcome message inside of your new Storybook dashboard!
